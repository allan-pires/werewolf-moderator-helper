# Werewolf Moderator Helper

## Description
This application was made to help the moderator of Ultimate Werewolf. The game can get quite confusing with a lot of players and the moderator has to remember every character of the game, as well as the play turn of each player. 

Here is a little of how this application can help the moderator:
- Determines the number of special classes per game by player quantity 
- Randomly chooses a character for each player
- Tells the moderator the player turn for every character in the correct order
- Has ambient sound that fits with the game :)

## The Game
Ultimate Werewolf is an interactive game of deduction for two teams: Villagers and Werewolves. The Villagers don't know who the Werewolves are, and the Werewolves are trying to remain undiscovered while they slowly eliminate the Villagers one at a time. A Moderator (who isn't on a team) runs the game.

Ultimate Werewolf takes place over a series of game days and nights. Each day, the players discuss who among them is a Werewolf and vote out a player. Each night, the Werewolves choose a player to eliminate, while the Seer learns whether one player is a Werewolf or not. The game is over when either all the Villagers or all the Werewolves are eliminated.
